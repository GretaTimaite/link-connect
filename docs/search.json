I hope you enjoy your time here as much as I have.\nSo, when Kylie asked us to prepare a 5 minute talk for this Knowledge Exchange session, my initial idea was to talk through my second project. But then as I started thinking about it a little bit more, I realised that is is KKNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE and not PROJECT EXCHANGE, so hey I don‚Äôt necessarily have to talk about one of my projects specifically. And this got me excited.\nI realised I can experiment a little bit. It might be a total failure or it might not.\nSo, first, can I ask if you already know your projects?\nBut this is what happened to me.\n\n\n\nTitle ü§î\nProject proposal üòß\nMe üòµ\n\n\n\nOK, so if you happen to be assigned to a project that you didn‚Äôt really know anything about and the research area is an area that you‚Äôd never think of doing research in because it‚Äôs so far away from your interests.\nI tried to visualise my reaction to my first project.\nSo what have I done to unpack this, so it starts making sense?\nI started asking myself if there‚Äôs something that I connect to."
